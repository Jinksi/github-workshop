### What is Git? Why is it useful?

- Version Control, specifically designed for code
  - I hope I didn’t delete something I wasn’t meant to
  - I better create a new version of this file with called ‘version 134’
  - Someone else edited this file on DropBox and I have no idea what they changed
- Collaboration
  - One source of truth
  - Multiple "branches" of the code can exist and can be worked on in parallel
  - "Blame" – author, timestamp and commit info for each line of code
- Limitations/Challenges
  - Large files can be awkward to deal with
    - Generally recommend to not add files larger than 50MB (GitHub will block files larger than 100MB)
  - Using more advanced features requires using the command-line – [git.wtf](https://git.wtf)
  - When things go wrong (e.g. "merge conflicts"), [this can be a steep learning curve](https://xkcd.com/1597/)
